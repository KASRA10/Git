# git config
The `git config` command is very useful, especially when you are using Git for the first time or have installed a new Git. This command sets your identity with your name and email address. After this, any information or changes will be recorded with this credential.

# git version
That's correct. The `git version` command is used to check the Git version installed on your system. By executing this command, you can view information about your Git version.

# git init
You're correct. The first command you typically use to start a new project in Git is `git init`. This command initializes a new empty repository where you can then save your source code inside it.

# git clone
The `git clone` command is used to make a copy of an existing repository. There is a fundamental difference between `git init` and `git clone`.
You use `git clone` when you need a copy of an existing repository. The `git clone` command first uses the `git init` command and then proceeds to fetch all its content.

# git add
The `git add` command adds all new or modified files to the repository. This command provides various options for adding files and directories.
By replacing `<file>` with the path of the specific file you want to add, you can stage that file for commit.

# git commit
You're right. The `git commit` command is essential in Git as it adds the changes to the local repository.
If you don't use this command correctly, it can affect the quality of your project.

(git commit -m "<your message>")
(If you forget to enter the commit message and accidentally enter the edit screen, you can follow these steps:
1. Press `Esc` key to exit the editing mode in Git.
2. Type `:wq` (stands for write and quit) to save your changes and exit the editor.
This will save any changes made in the commit message file and close the editor, allowing you to proceed with committing your changes.)

# git status
The `git status` command is used to check the status of files and allows you to identify which files need attention. This command can be executed at any time.
You can use it between `git add` and `git commit` commands to see the status of your files, including any changes that have been staged or are still untracked.

# git branch
In a Git repository, there are often multiple branches. A branch is an independent line of code development.
The `git branch` command allows you to effectively manage branches. There are various options and switches available for working with Git branches:

i) To list all branches:
```

$ git branch
```

ii) To create a new branch:
```

$ git branch <branch_name>
```

iii) To delete a branch: 
```

$ git branch -d <branch_name>
```

# git checkout
Correct! The `git checkout` command is used for switching between branches. It is a powerful command and can be used as a versatile tool.

To switch to another branch:
```

$ git checkout <branch_name>
```

You can also create a new branch and switch to it in one step using the `-b` flag:
```

$ git checkout -b <your_new_branch_name>
```

# git remote
Exactly! The `git remote` command acts as a bridge between your local repository and the outside world. It is used when you need to establish a connection with a remote repository.
To connect your local repository to a remote one, you can use the following command:
```

$ git remote add <shortname> <url>
```

Here, `<shortname>` is an alias or nickname for the remote repository, and `<url>` is the URL of the remote repository.

# git push
After connecting to a remote repository (using the `git remote` command), it's time to send your changes to the repository.
You can use the following command to push your changes:
```

$ git push -u <short_name> <your_branch_name>
```

For example:
```

$ git push -u origin feature_branch
```

Before using the `git push` command, make sure you have set up the upstream source and branch in Git. You can do this by running:
```

$ git push --set-upstream <short_name> <branch_name>
```

# git fetch
If you need to download the latest changes from team members or other repositories, you can use the `git fetch` command.

This command downloads all information related to commits, references, etc. So, you can review those changes in your local repository before applying them.
```

$ git fetch
```

# git pull
The `git pull` command downloads the content (not just the metadata) and immediately updates your local repository with the latest changes.
To use this command, you specify the remote URL from which you want to pull the changes:
```

$ git pull <remote_url>
```

For example:

```
$ git pull origin
```

# git stash
The `git stash` command is used to temporarily save edited files. In the context of Git, "stash" means to store anything that hasn't been committed yet.
You can use the following command to stash your changes:
```

$ git stash
```

The following command lists all stashes:
```

$ git stash list
```

To easily apply a stash to your branch, you can use:
```

$ git stash apply
```

# git log
The `git log` command allows you to view all previous commits, starting from the latest commit.
To see the commit history of the current branch by default, you can use:
```

$ git log
```

However, you can use it with various options to view the commit history of all branches together. For example:
```

$ git log --all
```

This will show the commit history of all branches in your repository.

# git shortlog
The `git shortlog` command provides a summary of the `git log` command. If you only need a brief overview, this can be a useful command.
It is particularly helpful for seeing who has worked on what.
```

$ git shortlog
```

This command will display a summarized list of commits, grouped by author, along with the number of commits made by each author.

# git show
In comparison to the `git log` command, the `git show` command displays detailed information about a specific commit.
To view the details of a particular commit, you can use:
```

$ git show <your_commit_hash>
```

Here, `<your_commit_hash>` is the hash or identifier of the commit you want to inspect. The `git show` command will display information such as the commit message, author, date/time, and any changes made in that specific commit.

# git rm
Sometimes, you may need to delete multiple files. In such cases, the `git rm` command is used.
This command can remove tracked files from both the index and the working directory.
To delete a file using `git rm`, you can use:
```

$ git rm <your_file_name>
```

Here, `<your_file_name>` represents the name of the file you want to delete. The `git rm` command will not only remove the file from your working directory but also stage it for deletion in Git's staging area (index).

# git merge
The `git merge` command helps you combine changes from two branches into a single unified branch.
To merge the changes from one branch into another, you can use:
```

$ git merge <branch_name>
```

This command will merge the commits and changes made in `<branch_name>` into your current selected branch. It integrates the changes and creates a new commit that incorporates both sets of changes.

# git rebase
The `git rebase` command is similar to the `git merge` command. It merges two branches into a unified branch with one exception: `git rebase` rewrites the commit history.
If you have multiple private branches and want to merge them into a single branch, you should use the `git rebase` command. This creates a linear commit history.
To perform a rebase operation, you can use:
```

$ git rebase <base>
```

Here, `<base>` refers to the base branch or commit onto which you want to apply your changes. The `git rebase` command takes the commits from your current branch and replays them on top of `<base>`, effectively rewriting the commit history.

# git pull –rebase
In many cases, when using `git pull`, it is recommended to perform a rebase instead of a merge.
To do so, you can use the following option:
```

$ git pull --rebase
```

This command combines the actions of fetching the remote changes and then rebasing your local commits on top of those changes. It helps in maintaining a linear commit history and avoiding unnecessary merge commits.

# git blame
To examine the content of each line in a file and determine who made the changes, you can use the `git blame` command. This command helps identify who made modifications to a file.
To use it, you can run:
```

$ git blame <your_file_name>
```

Replace `<your_file_name>` with the name of the file you want to inspect. The `git blame` command will display each line in the file along with information about which commit and author last modified that particular line.

# git diff
Most of the time, before committing or pushing changes, it's important to compare two files or branches in Git. The useful command for this is `git diff`.

i) Comparing working directory with local repository:
```

$ git diff HEAD <filename>
```

This command compares the changes in the working directory with the last committed state (HEAD) for a specific file.

ii) Comparing two branches:
```

$ git diff <source branch> <target branch>
```

This command allows you to compare the differences between two branches. Replace `<source branch>` and `<target branch>` with the names of the branches you want to compare. It will show you all the differences between those branches.

# git clean
Using the `git clean` command, you can work with untracked files. This command allows you to remove all untracked files from your working directory. To work with tracked files, you should use the `git reset` command.
To remove all untracked files using `git clean`, you can run:
```

$ git clean
```

This will delete any untracked files and directories in your working directory that are not being tracked by Git.
Please note that the `git clean` command is a potentially destructive operation, as it permanently removes files. Make sure to use it with caution and double-check which files will be deleted before executing the command.

# git ls
The `git ls` command is not a built-in Git command. There is no direct `git ls` command in Git.
However, there are several variations of the `ls` subcommand that you can use with Git to list various aspects of your repository:

- `git ls-files`: This command lists all the files tracked by Git in the current working directory and its subdirectories.
- `git ls-tree`: This command shows the contents of a tree object (usually used to show the contents of a specific branch or commit).
- `git ls-remote`: This command displays references in a remote repository.

Each of these commands serves different purposes related to listing and displaying information about files, trees, or references within your Git repository.

# git ls -la
The `git ls -la` command is not a valid Git command. The correct syntax for listing files in Git is `git ls-files`.
However, if you are referring to the commonly used shell command `ls -la`, it lists all files and directories, including hidden ones (files and directories whose names start with a dot), in long format. The `-l` option provides detailed information about each file or directory, while the `-a` option shows all entries, including hidden ones.
To list all files and directories in your current working directory using the shell command:
```

$ ls -la
```

If you specifically want to list tracked files in Git using the `git ls-files` command:
```

$ git ls-files
```

# git checkout HEAD^
The `git checkout HEAD^` command is used in Git to move the current branch pointer to the commit preceding the current one. 
Specifically, `HEAD^` refers to the parent of the currently checked-out commit (the commit that `HEAD` points to). By executing `git checkout HEAD^`, you are switching your working directory and updating your branch pointer to that previous commit.
It's worth noting that using `git checkout` with a specific commit or reference can detach your head from a branch, so use this command with caution.

# git branch –f <branch name> <commit address> 
Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The correct command is `git branch -f <branch name> <commit address>`.
This command allows you to forcefully move or reset an existing branch pointer (`<branch name>`) to a specific commit (`<commit address>`).
For example, if you want to move the branch named "myBranch" to a specific commit with the hash "abc123", you would run:
```

$ git branch -f myBranch abc123
```

This will update the branch pointer of "myBranch" and set it to point at the specified commit, effectively moving the branch's reference.
Please note that using this command can potentially discard commits or create conflicts if not used carefully. It should be used with caution.

# git reset HEAD~<number>
The `git reset HEAD~<number>` command is used to move the current branch pointer and reset it to a previous commit in your Git history.
Here's how the command works:
- `HEAD~<number>`: Specifies the number of commits you want to go back from the current commit. For example, if you use `HEAD~1`, it refers to the immediate parent commit of the current one. If you use `HEAD~2`, it refers to two commits before the current one, and so on.
By running `git reset HEAD~<number>`, Git will move your branch pointer backwards by `<number>` commits, effectively "undoing" those commits and resetting your branch's reference point.
Please note that using this command can potentially discard or lose commits if not used carefully. It's recommended to create a backup or make sure you have a way to restore any lost work before performing a reset operation.

# git branch –b <newbranchName>
The correct command is `git branch -b <newBranchName>`. This command is used to create a new branch and switch to it in one step.
Here's how the command works:
- `<newBranchName>`: Specifies the name of the new branch you want to create.
By running `git branch -b <newBranchName>`, Git will create a new branch with the specified name (`<newBranchName>`) based on your current commit, and then immediately switch to that newly created branch. This saves you from having to run separate commands for creating a branch and switching to it.
For example, if you want to create a new branch called "myNewBranch" and switch to it, you would run:
```

$ git branch -b myNewBranch
```

Git will then create the "myNewBranch" at your current commit and automatically switch your working directory over to this newly created branch.

# git remote -v
The `git remote -v` command is used to display the list of remote repositories associated with your local Git repository. 
Here's how the command works:
By running `git remote -v`, Git will show you a list of all the remotes (remote repositories) that are configured for your local repository, along with their corresponding URLs. The `-v` option stands for "verbose" and provides more detailed output.
For example, if you run `git remote -v` and have two remotes configured, it might display something like this:
```

origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/anotheruser/repo.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/anotheruser/repo.git (push)
```

This shows that there are two remotes: "origin" and "upstream". It also displays the URL associated with each remote for both fetch and push operations.
The `git remote -v` command is useful when you want to see which remotes are linked to your local repository, as well as their URLs.

# touch README.md LICENSE .gitignore
The `touch` command is a shell command used to create new empty files in Unix-based systems. In the context of your question, running the following commands will create three files: README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
```

$ touch README.md
$ touch LICENSE
$ touch .gitignore
```

Each command creates a separate file with the specified name. The `.md` extension conventionally represents Markdown files often used for documentation or READMEs. The `LICENSE` file typically contains licensing information for your project. Lastly, the `.gitignore` file is used to specify patterns of files that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes.
Please note that if these files already exist in your current directory, running `touch` on them will only update their modification timestamp without changing their content.

# nano <file's name>
nano terminal, editing area(edit the file)
CTRL + O + Enter +> Save And Out
CTRL + X +> Exit
CTRL + Z +> Stop And Exit The Flow
(If ctrl + x does not work for you then your git is using vim. In that case, Press esc and type ":wq" (w- means for write, q - means for quit) and press enter.
In the future if you want to use nano as a default text editor. then go to the main screen on terminal. type: nano ~/.gitconfig
The above command line will open an empty file and in the empty file type: git config core.editor "nano"
then press ctrl + x and enter to save and get out.)
Clarify this stage:
You press i, and you enter insert mode. You can navigate around the text and insert what ever you want. When done, press Esc. This makes you exit insert mode. Next you have to press :wq, which means to write and quit.

# Simple steps to put your project in the github repository and even sync with it:
git init 
touch README.md LICENSE .gitignore 
git add . 
git status 
git commit –m "<message>" 
git remote add origin <link of reposetory> 
git push –u origin master 
git pull origin
