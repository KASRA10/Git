# Introduction
-This repository includes commands and useful command of Git.

# What is Git?
-Git is a version control system (VCS) that allows you to track all the changes made to a project and access the history of those changes. 
-Imagine working on a project as a team, where each programmer contributes to different parts of it. At the end of the workday, all team members commit their changes to Git. Now, you can easily see what each person has done, what modifications have been made to the project by which team member, and why those changes were made.

# What are the advantages of using Git?
-The most significant advantage of Git is its ability to work offline without being affected by internet connectivity issues or speed. Using Git makes project management much simpler, especially for large projects that are worked on collaboratively by teams. Another feature of Git is having complete access to previous versions of software.
-Moreover, you can even run Git on your local system's localhost.

# What is GitHub?
-GitHub is a social network or web hosting service for programmers. By signing up for GitHub, you can create a new repository for yourself and store your written code and projects in it. This allows other programmers around the world to see your code, make modifications, use your code, develop them further, or optimize them.
-Note: You do not need GitHub to use Git.
-Note: Git is accessible through the command line interface, but GitHub is a cloud-based Git with a structure that makes it easier for individuals and teams to use.

# What are the advantages of using GitHub?
-Easy and effective project management
-Increased security with personal packages
-Suitable hosting for all codes and applications
-Advancement of programming and coding skills

# What is GitLab?
-GitLab does exactly the same thing as GitHub; it is essentially a web hosting service or social network for programmers where you can share your own codes and projects with other programmers around the world. GitLab has been designed and implemented using Go and Ruby programming languages, and large companies such as IBM, Sony, Alibaba, and NASA use it. Iranian programmers usually face difficulties in using GitLab due to sanctions.
-By now you probably understand that GitHub's services are very similar to those of GitLab but they also have some differences.

# Differences between GitHub and GitLab:
-GitLab provides more professional features for accessing sources' levels of accessability options; meaning you can define or change full access levels for each person while on Github you can only determine if someone has access to your repository or not.
-If you need reports on changes made by yourself, then GitLab offers better professional features which are also simpler compared to Github.
-In Github you can have private repositories free of charge while in gitlab having private repositories requires paid subscription.
-Although Github is an older service than gitlab , gitlab attracts more users.
# Contribution
-well these commands are basic and based on my own experience as a result of that i thought with myself it would be better to be edited just by myself. üòÅ
